## Toggle Case
### Description
The function accepts a string as input and swaps the case of each character. 
### Input
- A string is input as an argument into the function.
- The string is then broken down such that each letter becomes an item in an array.
### Output
- All the letters then go into a for loop where all uppercase letters are converted to lowercase and all lowercase letters are converted to uppercase.
- THe output is then printed for the user to see.


## Number Generator
### Description
The JavaScript function accepts two numbers and generates an array of the numbers between them inclusive of the two numbers.
### Input
- Two numbers are entered as parameter values for the function.
### Output
- The two numbers are passed through a loop where the number that is lesser of the two is added to one until the greater number is reached. The values got from adding one are taken and stored in an initially empty array. 


## Prime Numbers Generator
### Description
- The function takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array containing only the prime numbers from the original array. It accurately identifies prime numbers and returns them in the same order they appear in the input array.
### Input
- The input is an array of numbers that are checked to determine the prime numbers.
### Determining the output
- The iterator function checks if each number in the array is divisible by the numbers that are less than it. If a divisor is found, the number is declared as not a prime number. The prime numbers are then stored into another array.
